This is a small workshop on tensorflow written by Gabriel Barello for the Ahmadian/Mazzucatto group meeting in January of 2019.

If you are reading this you've already gotten ahold of the git repo.

If you are running on a server, or something do the following. If you already have tensorflow, numpy and matplotlib installed, just go ahead and open the ipynb.

First we are going to create a conda environment for you to use tensorflow in. To do so run

`$./setup_conda_env.sh`

from the repo root. This created a barello_TF_workshop conda environment, activate it by running

`$source activate barello_TF_workshop`

from the git repo root. Now you can run the ipynb included in the repo inside this environment (I use a jupyter lab server connection that runs this environment automatically)
